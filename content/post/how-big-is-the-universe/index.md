## What can we compare the size of universe to?

I was recently starting to wonder about the size of the universe.
I mean, it's not like I thought I could really get down to really imagining this kind of gargantuan extent.
But I wanted to find a good analogy, so here it is:

Imagine the distance furthest distance humans will soon travel: the **distance from Earth to Mars**.
If you are lucky with planning, the shortest route takes almost an entire year (9 months) in a spaceship.

Now let's compare this distance to the **size of the observable universe**.
The ratio between these two distances is in the order of **10^16**.
That means there are 16 orders of magnitude in difference between these two lengths.

What can we compare this to?
Let's scale this down:
We will pretend our planet Earth is the universe.
Now imagine we wanted to drill a hole through the whole planet from one extreme to the other (e.g. from the North Pole to the South Pole).

If we had started drilling the equivalent of the Earth-Mars distance, how far would we have gotten?
One meter?
A millimeter?
The width of a human hair?

It turns out, we would have only gotten as far as the size of **one atom**.

## Can we even imagine this at all?

For me this starts to scratch the surface of trying to understand the sheer scale of the universe and the God behind it.
The problem with this analogy?
It still does not help a lot because I believe we humans cannot even really imagine the distance between Earth and Mars yet.

On Earth we comfortably handle thousands, sometimes maybe tens of thousands of kilometers in our brains.
On our beautiful planet, this is the order of magnitude we are (gladly) confined to.
But the travel from Earth to Mars (i.e. the shortest path) is in the 10s of **millions** of kilometers.
That is three orders of magnitude above what we normally deal with in daily life!

Why do I keep making such a fuss about orders of magnitude?
Maybe the well known video ["Powers of Ten"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0) can answer that for me.
I will just state a hypothesis:
I believe we humans cannot handle more than 12 orders of magnitude.
Everything beyond that will just not fit into our brains.

In everyday life we normally comfortably handle 8 to 10 orders of magnitude in space and time.
For space, that is e.g. from 10Âµm (10^-5 m) (about the width of a hair) to 100 km (10^5 m) (the [distance between Barcelona and LA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_km)).
For time, that is e.g. from 100 ms (10^-1 s) to 100 years (about 10^9 s).

If we stretch our imaginations we can go towards tens of thousands of kilometers (now we are 12 order of magnitude), and maybe we can begin to imagine 1,000 years and tens of milliseconds.
But I think beyond that we are just lost.
If any object is outside of these ranges we need to scale it up or down and compare it to things within this 10^12 scale.
But if we try to compare things that stretch this 10^12 limit, our brains are just to tiny to fit these in.

## How big is the universe really?

Now that we start to find words and numbers to describe the limits of our imagination, I think we start to really become capable of talking about how big the universe really is.

The size of the universe is estimated at multiple tens of billions (10^10) of lightyears.
One lightyear is roughly 10^16 m, so the size of our universe is in the ballpark of 10^26.

The smallest length that currently fits into our model of the universe is the Planck length at about 10^-35 m.
That means our universe exists at about **60 orders of magnitude**.
(The above numbers are for space only, but time is analogous because we are basing it on the same observations, on the same speed of light (for the upper bound) and the same [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) (for the lower bound).)

Our human imagination cannot even begin to nibble at these sizes.
I think our perception is even more logarithmic than it is linear, so we would actually be pretty well equipped to perceive these orders of magnitude, but our range is just so narrow ...

## One number that we **can** fit into our brains

I have to somehow finish this post, so let us focus on a very simple number, one that we really can fit into our brains: 5 percent.
Or, in other words, 0.05.
Or 5*10^-2 if you like ðŸ˜‰.

This is a bit less than the estimated amount of actual matter in the universe.
When looking at the size and distribution of mass and energy in our universe, then typical baryonic matter makes up less than 5 percent of it.

Savor that slowly:
You and me, animals, atoms, the planets, the stars, even all the galaxies, all these account for **not even one twentieth** of the universe!

And the rest of it is not even empty ...
The universe is said to be filled by [Dark Energy and Dark Matter](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy).
(I prefer to call them Invisible Matter and Invisible Energy.)

## God is great

And now can we take one step back and ponder for a moment what we *actually express* when we say that "God is great"?
Can we marvel at Him who inhabits the entire universe - not just the 5 % we can see and touch, but all of it?
Can we stand in awe of the One who not only creates a universe with 60 (and probably even more) orders of magnitude but even oversees every single one of it?

<!-- rejoice -->
Does it make us bow down dazzled at a God who lives both inside the smallest quark and the biggest cluster of galaxies?
<!-- cite Philippians -->
And does it make us fall down on our faces in worship that He - the One who is bigger than 10^60 in both time and space, the Uncreated who exists from before time into eternity - that He "lowered" himself to become a mere human like us, that He stripped Himself off of all His highest privileges, left behind His dimensions and Glory because He loves us?
I don't know about you but I cannot help but stammer in wonder like [Job](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+42link_placeholderversion=MSG):

> I admit it. I was the one.
> I babbled on about things far beyond me, made small talk about wonders *way* over my head.

> I admit I once lived by rumors of you; now I have it all firsthandâ€”from my own eyes and ears!
> I'll never again live on crusts of hearsay, crumbs of rumor.
