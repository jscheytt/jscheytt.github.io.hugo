I have developed quite some muscle memory in terminating vim via `:wqa`.
Now I can save one more character by retraining myself to use `:xa`! 😄

I also like how `:x` sort of symbolizes the close button ❌ of many window managers and their default behavior of saving when you close a file.

For more documentation open vim and type `:h :x`.

# Wait, now that you mention it ...

Well, turns out the documentation mentions an even easier way: Just press `ZZ` (without the colon) 😴

Now if only I could combine this to perform `:wqa` ...

Happy vim-ing! 👋
