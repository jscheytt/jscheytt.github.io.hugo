I have developed quite some muscle memory in terminating vim via `:wqa`.
Now I can save one more character by retraining myself to use `:xa`! 😄

I also like how `:x` sort of symbolizes the close button ❌ of many window managers and their default behavior of saving when you close a file.

For more documentation open vim and type `:h :x`.

# Wait, now that you say it ...

Well, turns out the documentation mentions there is an even easier way: Just press `ZZ` 😴

Same goes for closing vim completely: `ZQ`

Happy vim-ing! 👋
