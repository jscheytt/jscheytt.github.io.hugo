While listening to the Song of Songs recently, the following things stuck with me:

The Bridegroom marvels at the beauty of the Bride more than the Bride marvels at the beauty of the Bridegroom.

In chapter 4, the bridegroom praises the beauty of His bride for half the chapter.
At the end of chapter 5, she in turn marvels at His beauty and strength.
In chapter 6, the Bridegroom again speaks of her beauty, sometimes using similar or identical phrases as in chapter 4.
And in chapter 7 the praise from His mouth increases and intensifies, partially even beyond the intimate circle of the two.

For me, this unfolds the following:
Jesus knows our weakness and how much we depend on His affirmation.
His constant and recurring attention is the foundation of our lives.
Telling us the same thing multiple times does not tire Him.
His love for us is unbroken, and He rejoices in every small step we take in devotion to Him.

And the more steps we take toward Him and with Him, the more we grow in love for Him.
Equally, the more we grow in love for Him, the more He can lavish His love upon us.

But in [chapter 7](https://www.bibleserver.com/ELB.HFA/Hoheslied7%2C1) we see even more:

> 👏 Turn, Sulamith, turn in circles as you dance, for we want to admire you!  
> 😄 What is there to see when I dance the dance of Mahanajim?

The beauty of the bride is not just for the Groom.
Those outside the community get to see her beauty as well.
"Creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed." ([Romans 8:19](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/Romans8%3A19))
And Jesus delights in this - the beauty of His bride displayed is glory for Him, too!

But this beauty is not made visible to the public by the bride *aiming* at it — neither at having the beauty for her own sake nor at being seen.
She asks: "What's the matter? I'm just dancing for joy as usual!"
This is the beauty of life in the Kingdom of God:
We become so rooted in God and in His love for us that real beauty and redeemed joy (even with dancing) grow naturally out of it.
