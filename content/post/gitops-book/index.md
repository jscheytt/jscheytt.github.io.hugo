We did it:
Our [full-length book about GitOps in German](https://gitops-book.dev/) is now finally out!
You can order it anywhere in book stores both physical and online.

In fall 2023, Baris, Johannes, and me started writing this book with a vision for enabling German-speaking software teams to use GitOps so they can ship changes faster and with more confidence.
It is both the first book about GitOps in German, and from our research it seems like it is also by far the longest book *in any language* about GitOps (about 350 pages).

Are we going to translate it to English?
We sure are interested in doing so but we are still discussing how to do it in a consistent and cost-effective way.
