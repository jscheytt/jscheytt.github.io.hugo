This year I have switched from an Android smartphone (Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)) to an iPhone (SE 2020).

When switching, these things stood out to me:

* There is **no really usable calendar app**.
    * I was using [Business Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal) before and I still miss the month widget.
    * I have settled with [Google Calendar](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/google-kalender-terminplaner/id909319292) for now.
* The **swipe gestures** from all possible sides of the screen instead of the 1-dimensional top drawer menu are really interesting, and I have grown very fond of them.
* The **emergency contact** feature is well thought out.
* **Migrating WhatsApp chats** is only possible via paid 3rd party apps.
    * I paid 30 USD for [Dr. Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/buy/drfone-mac-restore-social-app.html), connecting both devices to a Desktop/Laptop computer, and it worked flawlessly (missing only the read/unread markers).
* The **mobile internet usage** from the stock system is higher than on Android and I have no way reducing it. It used up 17 out of my precious 100 MB monthly quota for system "software updates" although I deactivated that on the App Store.
* **Privacy** is probably a lot better than on Android. See [this article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/android-sends-20x-more-data-to-google-than-ios-sends-to-apple-study-says/). Makes sense as Apple is a hardware company and Google is a data company.
* I have a **lot more space** on my phone now and I don't have to worry about deleting apps for space.
* Many of the **default apps** and settings work really well for me - just I expected also from the MacOS experience.
    * But I deactivated all Office-ish apps
* I am **extremely disappointed** and shocked that there is no solution (not even a paid one) to **activate Do Not Disturb (DND) during calendar events**.
    * I used a small Android app called [Polite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.camsteffen.polite) before and there is no equivalent for it, not even by a long shot!
* Automatic dark/light mode depending on daytime is very nice.

And some iPhone SE-specific things I appreciate:

* Fingerprint/TouchID was a very good choice. It's kind of sad though that you can add only up to 3 fingerprints (just like on MacOS).
* The size is a great relief as it's smaller than most gigantic smartphones from basically all brands nowadays.
* The camera is really good even though it's just one lens.
