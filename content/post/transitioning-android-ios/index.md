This year I have switched from an Android smartphone to an iPhone.
When switching, these things really surprised me:

* No good calendar app. I was using Business Calendar before and I still miss the month widget
* The interesting side swipes instead of the 1-dimensional top drawer menu
* The down-up action menu is really helpful
* The emergency contact feature is nice
* Migrating WhatsApp chats is only possible via paid 3rd party apps (I paid 30 USD), connecting both devices to a Desktop/Laptop computer
* Mobile data usage from system is higher and I cannot really reduce it. It used up 17 out of my precious 100 MB monthly quota for system "software updates" although I deactivated that on the App Store
* Privacy is a lot better. See the study. Makes sense as Apple is a hardware company and Google is a data company
* I have a lot more space now and don't have to worry about deleting apps for space
* Many of the default apps and settings work really well for me. Just I expected also from the MacOS experience
    * e.g. Reader
    * but I deactivated all Office-ish apps
* I am disappointed that Dropbox uploads all photos - not just camera photos but everything that comes in through WhatsApp. There is no way to deactivate that
* I am extremely disappointed and almost shocked that is no solution (not even a paid one) to activate DND during calendar events. I used a small Android app called Polite before and there is no equivalent for it, not even by a long shot
* Automatic dark/light mode depending on daytime

iPhone SE specific:

* Fingerprint/TouchID is awesome. Sad though that you can add only up to 3 fingerprints (just like on MacOS)
* The size (smaller than most gigantic Totschl√§ger from all brands nowadays) is a big relief
* Camera is really good, although it's just one lens. I am coming from a Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016), though
