[Psalm 45](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV.NIV/Psalm45) celebrates a royal wedding.
The first part addresses the groom and the second addresses (mostly) the bride.
I am focussing on this second part verses 10 through 17, and I interpret it in one of the ways I see very much fit:
With the groom being both God the Father and God the Son, and the church as His bride.

| ESV/NIV                                                         | Interpretation                                                                                                                              |

| Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear            | Zone in on me with all your attention, my daughter                                                                                          |
| Forget your people and your father’s house                      | Leave behind what has given you earthly security by trusting in flesh                                                                       |
| And the king will desire your beauty                            | I look at you with eyes of love; you are so beautiful and I, your Bridegroom, desire you                                                    |
| Since he is your lord, bow to him                               | Surrender yourself to Me completely with your whole life                                                                                    |
| The city of Tyre will come with a gift                          | Then you will gain so much more than what you left behind: You are showered with gifts in My proximity and will no longer live in poverty   |
| People of wealth will seek your favour                          | You are no longer the Deserted Wife but the Desired One                                                                                     |
| All glorious is the princess within her chamber                 | To your own joy you discover ever more the beauty with which I made you                                                                     |
| Her gown is interwoven with gold                                | Even outsiders marvel at your beauty and praise Me for it                                                                                   |
| In embroidered garments she is led to the king                  | I draw you ever closer to Me, your King                                                                                                     |
| Her virgin companions follow her – those brought to be with her | You will not stay alone in this: You gain real companions who journey towards the King together with you                                    |
| With joy and gladness they are led along                        | In your devotion to Me you experience overflowing joy and rejoicing                                                                         |
| As they enter the palace of the king                            | Your home is with Me                                                                                                                        |
| In place of your fathers shall be your sons                     | Your life is made fertile and provides a space for others to grow                                                                           |
| You will make them princes in all the earth                     | Through the unfolding of My life in yours, your sons and daughters will exercise their responsibility in this world and reign in My Kingdom |
| I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations      | People in all nations will see this                                                                                                         |
| Therefore nations will praise you forever and ever              | And they will praise the Father, the Son, and the Spirit throughout all eternity                                                            |
