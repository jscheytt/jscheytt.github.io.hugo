* reading bible in order of Hebrew bible, the Tanach (TNK)
* recently came across Ruth: Prov31 t√ºchtig woman is directly adjoined by book Ruth
    * showing: being a praiseworthy person in God's eyes is not first of all related to being an Israelite - but instead by putting your trust in the God of Israel, and putting in all your effort accordingly
* It becomes clear that Ruth does not go to Israel because of Naomi or Israel
    * Naomi is bitter, blinded by her focussing on her tragic loss
    * In Israel, she will be a widow with a dim future
        * and a foreigner at that! expect no mercy from the Jews
    * Boaz recognizes it! you have come to find shelter under the wings of the God of Israel
    * Seems like she actually came to know this God (who manifested Himself in His Son Jesus) during the 10 years of her marriage
        * experiencing in her daily life the prayers and the living together with this God in her extended family
* clinging
    * Orpah leaves Naomi, but Ruth "clings to her"
    * Same word as in Gen2 a man will leave his parents and cling to his wife
        * = sticking to (my tongue clings to the roof of my mouth Ps137:6)
        * = the Philistine armies chased the Israelites (sticked to their heels), Ruth attached herself to the maidens of Boaz
        * It is about glueing, but in a very active sense: You pin or attach yourself to someone
    * God wants us to stick to him - because we wants us to be near to Him (just like He chose to attach Himself to His bride)
        * If we do not only draw near to Him from time to time but instead **live** with Him and glue ourselves to Him, then we will automatically follow Him, obey Him and live in close connection with Him
        * ever more experiencing 2Col3:18
    * Tanach next: Song of Songs: the same kind of chasing after Him
* short-sighted looking on human/earthly things instead of joining in God's action
    * Elimelech only saw a famine and tried to secure physical survival for his family by moving to Moab
        * Still he and his sons died
    * Naomi only saw her loss
        * although she later recognizes God's hand moving in their favor
    * The closer redeemer only sees his own possession and tries to secure his family's inheritance and prosperity by relying on his riches
    * But both Ruth and Boaz see something greater
        * Their eyes are on God first
        * Ruth has no problem in trusting God to take care of her in a foreign country with (from a mere human perspective) a dim, impoverished existence at the margins of society for the rest of her life
        * She does not feverishly spring into action but faithfully gathers grain for her mother-in-law and herself throughout all the months of the harvest before Naomi herself suggests asking Boaz to redeem them
        * Boaz does not frantically venture on either: he understood all along that God was moving here and that he could trust Him to bring everything together at the right time
            * He is not even afraid about the closer redeemer
        * They both see that God is at work to do something bigger than what they can currently perceive
        * And they willingly intertwine their actions with God's movements
