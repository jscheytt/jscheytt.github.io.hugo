If I were to pick just one book that has deeply changed the way I see the world and that has practically impacted the way I live, it would be this book (apart from the Bible).
[Dallas Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Willard) was a Professor of Philosophy in the US who, during the course of his 70+ years on earth, found insight into how living in step with God Himself actually became possible in Jesus.

He accurately shows how our current Christian worldview wrongly preaches "barcode" salvation and errs by positioning itself on a binary spectrum of either "cheap grace" or strong moral discipline.
The solution to our "upside-down" perspective is attending the masterclass of The Great Teacher Jesus, the uncontested Master of Life.

The Beatitudes and basically all of the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount never really made sense to me - until I read this book!
"The Divine Conspiracy" is not about setting up another new law, even harder to fulfill than the Torah.
