* one of the books that was hard to read and understand
* since journey into rediscovering, the AT also starts lighting up
    * He is The Word John 1. When you read the Bible, you read Him. Rechne damit, Ihm zu begegnen
* What does a Kingdom way of treating each other in bad times look like? How do you love a friend who is suffering a big loss?
* 7 days and nights with him in the ashes, the ostracism, the sickness
* let him/her start talking instead of starting the talking yourself
* but then not like the 3:
    * they are not truthful: they don't know why the trouble and loss came, just like Job himself
    * they try to justify God's actions (as if the Good Lord had any need for small humans jumping to his defense!) by making Job look bad
    * they say tons of right things
        * even prophecy things that later on actually happen! (like 2x)
        * but they don't say it because they trust in God - their heart is not right, they just try to be on the right side of the argument instead of loving their friend
        * they speak truth but without love
* Elihu finds the third way beyond the spectrum of Job and his friends:
    * he approaches Job in a resolute but loving manner
    * talks to both sides
    * it's not about is God unjust or has Job sinned
        * just like JÃ¼nger beim Blindgeborenen
        * it's about God speaking to us through **all** of life's circumstances
            * Where do you hear God speaking?
    * it's about learning to discern where and what God is speaking
        * and trusting that He is infinitely good
* And then Job hears God speaking
    * and showing him why he is wrong
* And God confronts Job's friends in fury for not speaking truthfully
    * saying that Job was saying the truth about Him - although He seems to contradict himself in his statements about God many a time
    * it's clear: God wants "Wahrheit im Inneren" (Psalms 51)
