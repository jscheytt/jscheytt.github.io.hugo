Hey there,

My name is Josia Scheytt ([[josˈiːa ʃaɪ̯t](https://namedrop.io/josiascheytt)]).
I live in the South of Germany near Stuttgart.

Technically, I am interested in all things DevOps and Cloud Automation.
My life as a whole is about following The One and Only, Jesus.

This blog serves mostly as a small utility to keep track of things I have learned, but also as a way of sharing knowledge.
For me this is a vital part of living DevOps.

You can find me on:
